# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

NOTE: As semantic versioning states all 0.y.z releases can contain breaking changes in API (flags, grpc API, any backward compatibility)

We use *breaking* word for marking changes that are not backward compatible (relates only to v0.y.z releases.)

## [v0.9.0](https://github.com/bwplotka/bingo/releases/tag/v0.9.0) - 2020.05.05

Initial release ðŸ’ªðŸ’ª ðŸ’ª

Why 0.9.0? Well, because we plan to release 1.0 once we introduce this tool to [Thanos](http://github.com/thanos-io/thanos) and [go-grpc-middleware](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-middleware) as the final test (:
